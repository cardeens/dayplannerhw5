Homework 5 - Due 3/19 

## Description

This assignment required us to create a day planner using Moment.js and JavaScript. The planner covers a normal work day, and allows us to add events to a certain hour block. The timeblocks also change format based on whether the time is before or after that particular time block. Moment.js was a key component because it allowed us to create JS logic that could tell what time and date the user is currently on. With this info, we can alter the format to create the best possible user experience

## Usage

To use this app, simply click into a timeblock and add an event for the hour, and click the Save button once complete. You can also edit or delete certain events.

## Testing

When adding timeblocks, they should be saved to the planner after clicking the Save button to the left of the hour blocks. You should also notice a current time marker, with the formatting changing for times before/after the current hour. This helps the user quickly identify past and future events on their planner.
